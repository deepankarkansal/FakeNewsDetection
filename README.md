# FakeNewsDetection

In this project we have taken 2 datasets from kaggle and created the 3rd one(from the 1st dataset) to show the working on the biased dataset.
We tried out various models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Bi-LSTM using Glove embeddings. We showed the accuracies plot for the same and found models are achieving accuracy of 96% on the dataset1 and 99% on dataset2 and 50% on the biased dataset i.e. Dataset3.
